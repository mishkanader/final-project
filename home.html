        <h2>Welcome to Permanent Addiction</h2>

        <p>Did you know, that about 90% of adults and children are addicted to caffeine? Well it's true!</p>

        <h3>What do you know about coffee?</h3>

        <p>Coffee is the one of the most addicting legal drug that can be found in a lot of things. It can be found in
          painkillers, green tea, and even chocolate. The average person who buys coffee outside of their home and
          work spend about the equivalent value of a round plane trip to Florida every year. It takes about 5 years
          before the coffee berries are ready to pick and one tree is the equivalent of one pound of roasted
          coffee!</p>

        <p>Coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia when they noticed their goats “dancing” after eating coffee
          berries. At first in Africa, people ate coffee berries with fat that were like energy balls. In 1675, the
          King of England banned coffee because the believed that, that was were people went to conspire against him.
          The only state that grows coffee in the United States is Hawaii and is the second most traded commodity
          (right after oil) in the world. The beans (after peeled out of the red berry) are roasted for a few minutes
          then pop and double in size. After it pops a second time, the beans are done, kind of like popcorn.</p>
